I'm a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Water, Health, and Opportunity Lab](https://xindicindyhu.org/) at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. Most of my research lies at the intersection of drinking water quality and public health. I have led a variety of projects on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals") using techniques from data science and the lab. I try to imbue this work with my interests in open science, data visualization, and science communication.

I recently [defended](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/42719616) my PhD in population health sciences in the Environmental Health Department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH) and was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Sunderland Biogeochemistry of Global Contaminants Lab](https://sunderlandlab.org/). Before that, I received my master of science degree in environmental health from HSPH, and my bachelor's degree in environmental science and engineering from Harvard College. Before graduate school, I worked as a Sustainability Consultant at Sphera (formerly thinkstep), where I primarily conducted environmental life cycle assessments.

In my spare time, I enjoying playing the flute (especially chamber music) and tennis, reading, and baking bread. All of this leaves me with tons of time to gossip with my dog, Georgette.
